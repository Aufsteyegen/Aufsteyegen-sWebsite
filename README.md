## Reflection

* If you had more time, what would you like to incorporate into your website? How would it improve the user’s experience? What challenges would you anticipate when trying to implement the feature?

I would have liked to explore more accessibility options. For instance: I think it’s possible to make websites navigable using the keyboard only. I’m curious as to what HTML elements enable this. Stylistically, I'd like to implement animations to each of the sections (e.g., a floating effect), as well as 3D   modeling/animations. These would improve user experience by making the website more engaging; static websites are fine, but I feel like I can do a better job of showcasing my creativity, and enabling others to enjoy that. 

* Why do you think web accessibility is important, and why did you choose your specific features to include?

Making a website accessible is mutually-beneficial for the developer and user. For the developer, this means their message can reach/help everyone possible. For the user, this means they can support the developer by engaging with their website. I chose to include alt-text for images so that users using screen readers can understand the images. I reserved heading tags for section headers so that users can easily identify important sections of the website. And I implemented font sizes of at least 16px so that users have an easy time learning about me.

Note: I am concerned about the cursor blinking animation effect. I reduced the animation time to minimize distractions, but I'm not sure it's compliant with the best accessibility practices.
